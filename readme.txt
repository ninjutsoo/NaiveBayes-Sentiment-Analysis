actually what we do here is we first shuffle all the tweets and then we choose [:100] for train and [100:] (817 tweets) for test.
-- How to run:
    1- run all the cells.
    2- after first run, you just need to run from a cell we showed to the end, for many times that you want. (we got 49 more runs for total 50 results)
    3- average has all the results and after runs we got an average of accuracy for our Naive bayes that for me is 0.7953999999999999. (for 50 results)

each time we shuffle tweets and separate train and test from each other so the accuracy would be useful after many runs (50 in my picture).
